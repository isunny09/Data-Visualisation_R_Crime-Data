The project aimed to analyze and visualize the Centre For Policing Equity data, focusing on incidents and police force details in Dallas, Texas. The primary goal was to investigate potential racial disparities or injustices within the police force. The project utilized R programming and various data visualization libraries to uncover insights from the dataset.
Key Findings:

Incidents by Month:
The analysis revealed a decline in the overall crime rate, with December having the fewest incidents.
March 2016 recorded the highest number of incidents.

Incidents by Division:
The Central Division had the highest number of reported incidents.
The Northwest Division had the lowest number of incidents, suggesting it may be a relatively safer area.

Officer Gender Distribution:
The police force was predominantly male, with only about 10% of officers being female.

Arrest Statistics:
Approximately 86% of incidents resulted in the arrest of the suspect.

Subject Description:
Mental instability was a common factor in incidents, followed by alcohol-related issues.
Black and White individuals were equally involved in "FD-Motor Vehicle" descriptions.

Common Offenses:
The most common offenses included "APOWW," "Assault," and "No Arrest."

Force Used:
Verbal commands were the most used force, followed by tasers and weapon displays.

Incidents Across Divisions:
Public intoxication was most common in the Central Division, while assault incidents were highest in the Southwest Division.

Geographic Visualization:
A geographic map visualized incidents color-coded by the race of the suspects, providing a spatial perspective on the data.

Conclusion:
The analysis of the Centre For Policing Equity data for Dallas, Texas, in 2016 did not provide conclusive evidence of racial discrimination by the police towards any race. While incidents involving Black individuals were more prevalent, the analysis lacked data on the legitimacy of arrests or other charges faced by suspects. Additionally, the demographic composition of the police force influenced the patterns of officer involvement in incidents.
Overall, the project highlighted important insights into policing and incidents in Dallas, Texas, and emphasized the need for further research and data collection to gain a more comprehensive understanding of policing practices and racial disparities.
